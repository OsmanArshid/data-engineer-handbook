-- Making a master data table by the help of 
-- "cumulative table" technique

-- Steps:
-- 1. Make 2 tables (yesterday and today)
-- 2. COALESCE them
-- 3. FULL OUTER JOIN THEM

-- FROM player_seasons;

-- SELECT *
-- FROM players;

-- we are making the type on just the attributes that change and also we kinda understand
-- this is a data type of its own
-- CREATE TYPE season_stats AS (
-- 			season INTEGER,
-- 			gp INTEGER,
-- 			pts REAL,
-- 			reb REAL,
-- 			ast REAL
-- );
-- DROP TYPE season_stats

-- CREATE TYPE scoring_class AS ENUM ('star', 'good', 'avg', 'bad')

-- seperating the values that will stay the same and combining the season stats struct as an array
-- CREATE TABLE players( 
-- 		player_name TEXT, 
-- 		height TEXT,
